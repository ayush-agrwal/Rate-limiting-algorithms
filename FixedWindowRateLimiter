Concept:
The Fixed Window Counter algorithm counts the number of requests in a fixed time window. If the count exceeds the limit, further requests are denied until the window resets.

Advantages:

Easy to Implement: Simple counting mechanism.
Predictable: Limits are clear and easy to understand.
Disadvantages:

Burstiness: Requests right before the window resets can exceed the limit.
Rigid: Does not adapt well to varying traffic patterns.

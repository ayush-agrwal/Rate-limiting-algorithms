Sliding Window Log
Concept:
The Sliding Window Log algorithm maintains a log of timestamps for each request. It checks whether the number of requests in the recent time window exceeds the limit.

Advantages:

Precise: Tracks individual request timestamps for accurate rate limiting.
Adaptable: Handles varying traffic patterns better.
Disadvantages:

Memory Usage: Requires storage of request timestamps, which can be memory-intensive.
Complexity: More complex to implement and manage compared to simpler algorithms.

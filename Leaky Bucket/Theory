Leaky Bucket
Concept:
The Leaky Bucket algorithm processes requests at a constant rate. Excess requests are discarded if the queue (bucket) is full, regardless of the rate at which they arrive.

Advantages:

Smooth Out Traffic: Ensures a consistent rate of request processing.
Simplicity: Straightforward to implement using a queue.
Disadvantages:

Request Loss: Excess requests are discarded, which may not be acceptable in all scenarios.
Limited Flexibility: Doesnâ€™t handle bursts well as requests are dropped if the bucket overflows
